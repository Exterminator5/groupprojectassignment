                Soviet Union on the Eastern Front

                Originally, Hiter had a non-aggression pact called the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with the 
                Soviet Union which dictated that they would not attack one another as well as divide the contries 
                that lied between them. Howver, Germany invaded the Soviet Union by surprise in 1941. This was the 
                largest land invasion with over 10 million lives taking part in the conflict. The Soviet Union had a massive amount of 
                troops but lacked the same amount of infrastructure that Germany had. As a result, the Soviet losses were massive 
                at about 27 million through the war. Of these roughly 10 million were military personnel.

                The deadliest battle in World War two was The Battle of Stalingrad. 
                It lasted five months with German forces working to take the city. 
                In this one battle alone the Soviet Union lost 1.2 million lives defending Stalingrad. 
                This long and bloody battle resulted in a victory for the Soviet Union and is considered to 
                be the major turning point on the Eastern Front as it pushed the German armies back.

            <h2>
                The Reach of Lend-Lease
            </h2>

            <img id="lendlease" src="images/lendleasteastern.jpg" alt="British Lend Least to Soviet Union" >  

            <p>
                Both Britain and the United States used Lend-Lease Programs to send supplies to 
                the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front. This totalled $11.3 billion or a staggering $180 billion in modern currency.
                While the USSR recieved many tanks from the British, most weren't loved by the crews. The reasons for this have more to do with
                the environment than the machines themselves. British armor typically had think tracks, this meant that there wasn't a lot there 
                to deal with the extremely muddy ground that went on for months on the eastern front. Tanks that were amazing on the western front, 
                such as the Matilda were loathed by their crews. On the flipside, the American tanks were a massive hit. This was mostly to do with their infamous reliablity. 
                They were extremely difficult to break down, and they had to be because they were going across the Atlantic. The Lend Lease program was massive, and it was a huge boon for the 
                Allies that they had such equipment, albeit at a price.

            <h3>
                The T-34
            </h3>

            <p>
                The T-34 was the Union's most prominent tank on the eastern front. 
                Introduced in 1940, around 65,000 of them were produced. At the start of the war, 
                the T-34's were undergunned. The armor was able to withstand small anti 
                tank munitions but against tanks it was underwhelming. However it performed well 
                overall and the hulls were adapted to many other tanks such as the SU series of tanks. 
                The T-34 itself was also upgraded with a larger turret fitting both a larger gun as well 
                as more crew space. The T-34s served as the Union's main medium tank up until the end of the war.

            <h3>
                The KV Series
            </h3>

            <p>
                The KV series were a group of heavy tanks used by the USSR during the war. 
                The first of these, the KV-1, was practically immune to all German weapons at the time, 
                and it wasn't until Germany further developed their weapons that they could take them on. 
                This would eventually lead into the KV-2, armed with a 152mm howitzer meant for bunker busting.
