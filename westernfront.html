            <p>
                France declared war on Germany immediately following the invasion of Poland. Germany started its invasion of Belgium, 
                Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and France in 1940. The invasion of France lasted a mere six weeks due to the blitzkrieg tactic used. 
                This was a hard and fast style of attack involving many motarized vehicles and tanks. France officially surrendered on June 22, 
                1940 at the location of the 1918 Armistice signing.

            <p>
                After the Invasion, France would remain under German occupation until June 6, 1944 following the D-Day invasion in 
                Normandy. During this time Germany used French factories to produce weapons and tanks, as well as adding to their 
                own forces by taking what tanks France had.

            <p>
                Britain would fight both in Northern Europe as well as Africa. Britain made up the bulk of the western front 
                as the United States didn't offically join the war until Pearl Harbor in 1941. Britain would fight in the Arctic regions to protect their convoys to the Soviet Union on the eastern front. 
                Germany's main priority on the sea was sinking convoys from the United Kingdom to the Soviet Union as well as 
                the convoys from the United States to Britain as a result of the Lend-Lease Program. When Germany also started it's North African Campagin, Britain sent troops south and remained largely alone in this until the United States joined the war.

            <p>
                After Pearl Harbor, the United States entered the war and as such sent troops to the western front. 
                It would assist Britain in Europe as well as Arfica. Additionally, it would be a key player in D-Day to retake France in 1944. approximately 1.5 million American soldiers would be deployed to fight on the western front.

            <p>
                While the main Allies, the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are most well known, 
                other nations did fight on the side of the Allies in WWII. One of those was Canada. Canada sent roughly 
                1.1 million soldiers to the western front and participated in D-Day as well.

                HMCS Haida was a Canadian warship that served from 1943 all the way to 1963. During World War II she was assigned to the British Fleet and had operations of the coast of France. She sunk the most tonnage out of all Canadian ships and remains afloat today as a museum ship.
